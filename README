# About onefoot

Onefoot is just a wrapper around [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), 
the universal text converter, which allows you to create a simple static pages 
with:

* a html wrapper for writing headers, footers, css, javascript.
* html partials for creating elements which gets concatenated together.
* custom key:value pairs to use arbitrary information in your posts.

Notice that there is no "%title%" element at the top - so it gets excluded from 
the index page.

## How do I do stuff?

1. Write text in markdown.
2. Edit _wrapper and _post templates to your liking.
3. Run "./make.sh;open index.html" to see results.

If you want to do something interesting, have a look at make.sh.
